Ideas

Safari Zone game - Will be a text adventure-esque game where you explore the safari zone and capture Pokemon by using items and pokeballs. The Safari Zone will be comprised of various zones that will have their own unique pokemon that will be selected and contained within arrays. The player character will "move" and randomly run into pokemon. A battle scenario will occur and the player will use items to "weaken" pokemon. On the third attempt, player can use a pokeball to capture the pokemon and will be retained in firebase. "X" number of captures can be accomplished before "gameover".
